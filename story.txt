Once upon a time in a cool city named Toronto (the 6ix), there was a class of ambitious students who wanted to learn code. 
The group is made up of all different individuals from all walks of life.
One is a vampire, another is a zombie, another is a british spy... and one with a secret past so sinister...
But everyone is trying to help each other
That is until the vampire realised the british spy was a werewolve, then everything changed...
The vampire flashed his big white teeth...
"All sound and fury signifying nothing, as the quote goes," opined the werewolf, and continued "Your Level 9000 sunblock is about to wear off, so back to your crypt, creature of the night."
The vampire sneered but retreated, noting that without the full moon the would-be lupine posed no great threat. They would take up their dispute at a later date under more appropriate circumstances.
